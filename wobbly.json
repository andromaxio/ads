There is no real depth to the game but honestly that's a lot of its charm for me I found it more enjoyable than Totally Reliable Deliver Service so far but that's just a personal opinion. UPDATE: Forgot to mention, I have two computers which is why I bought two copies If you have a few xbox one controllers you can also play on the same computer, it supports up to 4 players this way via split screen."
